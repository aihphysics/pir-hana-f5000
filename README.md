# Pir-hana F5000

## Outline
This is a second iteration of the Pir-hana design, the F5000. There are several design flaws that this revision aims to target, these are outlined by the following requirements:
* Field access to anchors and recovery system without tooling.
* Airframe material with more options for hardware mounting methods.
* Multiple seperate bays, options for dual deploy while maintaining sufficient avionics.
* Options for multiple weight mount points, expanding range of applicable motor classes, while maintaining single-deployment model and stability.
* Mount point for forward fin group, expanding range of applicable motor classes without significantly reducing apogee.

## Index
* To be completed.
